# Mobile Vault

Mobile Vault was a group design project that 5 more colleagues and I were working on during a Computer Engineering Design Studio course. Our mission was to integrate all that we had learned so far on Python, Raspberry Pi and sensors to create a small-scaled application that works. My roles in the project were developing the Frontened and verifying the integration of hardware (sensors, etc.) and software (Python).
